                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> Hello! I need your vote. My name is sniperxxxxxxxxxxxx! I'm excited to have the opportunity to help
                    Stateview prison. And with your vote, that opportunity can become a real reality.

                    A little about myself. I've been apart of the Stateview Prison Community since 2021. Furhtermore
                    I've been on the roblox platform since 2016 and been in tons of amazing groups. This includes Mano
                    County Sheriff Office, Roblox Adventures , United States Military 1960's , and many more clothing
                    groups, military groups, and role-playing groups in general. These groups have shaped me into who I
                    am on the internet today and my take on roblox groups. I love devoting time and effort into big
                    projects. As governor that will definitely give me that opportunity.

                    I hope I can make a difference and gain your vote. Thank you for reading about me and if you have
                    questions on policies and my future plans as Governor, feel free to ping me and ask and I'll answer
                    as soon as I can.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hello. I am phy. I am @sniperxxxxxxxxxxxx 's running mate and I will be assisting him throughout his
                    campaign for governor. We have a lot of great ideas for Stateview and are going to completely shift
                    the view I am a Superintendent and also a game administrator. I have been with the Stateview
                    community for a while and I am extremely devoted. We have amazing ideas that could completely shift
                    the view on Stateview. In addition to all of the ideas that we have, Sniper is extremely dedicated
                    to this
                    game as you can see above in his experience. He is SVGA, SVOC, a Facility Director, it is his second
                    time running for governor, and he was helping out making v3 a great game. All of this shows the
                    extreme dedication that Sniper has for this game, and they prove that he would be an amazing fit for
                    the role of governor!
