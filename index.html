                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> Hello! I need your vote. My name is sniperxxxxxxxxxxxx! I'm excited to have the opportunity to help
                    Stateview prison. And with your vote, that opportunity can become a real reality.

                    A little about myself. I've been apart of the Stateview Prison Community since 2021. Furhtermore
                    I've been on the roblox platform since 2016 and been in tons of amazing groups. This includes Mano
                    County Sheriff Office, Roblox Adventures , United States Military 1960's , and many more clothing
                    groups, military groups, and role-playing groups in general. These groups have shaped me into who I
                    am on the internet today and my take on roblox groups. I love devoting time and effort into big
                    projects. As governor that will definitely give me that opportunity.

                    I hope I can make a difference and gain your vote. Thank you for reading about me and if you have
                    questions on policies and my future plans as Governor, feel free to ping me and ask and I'll answer
                    as soon as I can.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> Hey, I'm Ev4maa, but you can call me Emma. I am delighted to be Sniper's running-mate! I've worked
                    in many previous establishments before, such as beachblox where I was chairwoman and overseen
                    Coastguard and Mafia. Sadly, over the recent years, I took a break from the platform, but I do want
                    to come back with a bang. It sounds like you have had some interesting experiences in different
                    roles. If there's anything specific you'd like to share or discuss, feel free to let me know!
