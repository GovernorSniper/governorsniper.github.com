                <h3>Policy Changes</h3>
                <p> Here at my campaign, I want to ensure we fix the problems Stateview has before we get into Version 3
                    of our game. This includes
                    Corruption, (Biased-Promotions, Biased-hand selections for departments, Biased punishments for
                    individuals, etc..)
                    Regulation Updates, (Training guide faces regulations, update punishment regulations to be more
                    situation friendly (helps remove grey lines)
                    High Ranking Individuals (Have term evaluations and use constructive criticism on SHR Individuals,
                    also implement better constructive criticism for HR Exams, and make them more frequent (or scheduled
                    one week ahead and not at random)).
                    Administrator Friendly environment (Create fewer channels and barriers to take administrative
                    actions against an individual).
                    Game Administrator tools (Give Game Administrators access to Staff Cuffs to better discipline
                    individuals)
                    Add a vote-kick system (Adding a vote-kick system will help reduce the stress on Game Administration
                    and help players enjoy the game more without issues THIS WILL BE WARDEN+)
                    Representing Lower Ranking Individuals (High ranks too often don't understand LR's point of view, I
                    will select capable, worthy, and dedicated individuals to be board representatives to better educate
                    the High Ranking individuals on concerns of Low Ranks)
                    Community Involvement (Board representatives obviously won't be enough, so I will have two meetings
                    a month with the concerns the community has, and help fix them.)


                    Now obviously there are more issues, but I can't list them all. But with your help, we name and fix
                    them.

                <h3>Where Is The Funding Going</h3>
                <p>$R 10,000/$100 USD | Towards giveaways throughout my term

                    $R 150,000 | Towards game development throughout my term. (Examples: Improvement of Criminal base
                    and objectives, ACTUALLY opening the basement, improvement on cars. (Based on V2 <<<) (V3 is too
                        early to tell, but we will do the best we can if it comes out during my term of office). $R
                        10,000/$R 20,000 / $100/$200 USD | Towards creating a LIMITED item for players that play
                        Stateview. This will increase the growth of the community and help show you are a veteran within
                        a few years. $R 75,000 | Towards ads for the group, we need to recruit members along with retain
                        them. $R 20,000 / $200 USD | Towards department development and improvement. (This can be of
                        means by recruitment, hiring someone to watch department operations, motivate individuals to
                        obtain employee of the week, etc..) $R 25,000 / $250 USD | Towards a Saving/Emergency fund for
                        Stateview and the Campaign incase things go sideways I believe this is a great layout and a
                        reasonable budget for the 12 weeks I am Governor. Vote for me to support it! </p>

                <h3>Focusing on creating a fair and equal community</h3>
                <p>I will employ a Policy that allows peers to have the chance to vote once a month, for deserving
                    individuals to promote, join departments, or receive rank enhancers (Ex. EHR) that High Ranking
                    Individuals might not see. I believe allowing lower-ranking individuals to help will include them
                    more as a part of the community along with boosting the confidence of the community. </p>

                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>Approach/Gameplan:
                    Week 1: Establish a Chain of Command and High Command with reliable players within Stateview
                    Week 2: Supervise Media High Command implementing Regulations | Open applications for players to
                    join the department
                    Week 3: Accept Applications and start department training/trial.
                    Week 4: Finish department training/trials.
                    Week 5-12: Have the department fully operational reaching out to Social Media Influencers as
                    intended and boosting Stateview's Social Media campaign.</p>
